// Steps :

// Lexical Analysis: The first phase, where the source code is broken down into tokens
// such as keywords, operators, and identifiers for easier processing.

// Syntax Analysis or Parsing: This phase checks if the source code follows the correct syntax rules,
// building a parse tree or abstract syntax tree (AST).

// Semantic Analysis: It ensures the programâ€™s logic makes sense, checking for errors like type mismatches or undeclared variables.

// Intermediate Code Generation: In this phase, the compiler converts the source code into an intermediate,
// machine-independent representation, simplifying optimization and translation.

// Code Optimization: This phase improves the intermediate code to make it run more efficiently,
// reducing resource usage or increasing speed.

// Target Code Generation: The final phase where the optimized code is translated into the target machine code
// or assembly language that can be executed on the computer.
